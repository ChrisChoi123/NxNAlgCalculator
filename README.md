# NxNAlgCalulator
This program calculates the amount of algs (3-style comms) in the average NxN blind solve. It shows both my (Chris Choi) formula and Tom Nelson's formula from 2017. 

Thanks Graham Siggins for much of the information. This calculation was done assuming fixed buffer 3-style. For the corners and midges, I accounted for floating 2-twist and 2-flip. With these assumptions, Stanley Chapel arrived at 10.3 for the average alg count of a 3x3 solve. I also assumed the implemetation of the advanced "avoiding cycle breaks" during centres. For odd NxNs, the calculation was rather straightforward, but for even NxNs, I had to take account to the fact that you can orient it in an advantageous way due to lack of centre pieces. I did this using a modified inverse tangent function, which has the desired properties of an asymptote at infinity and a steep initial ascent.
I use 2 formulas, one for even and one for odd, where n is the number of layers.  

Odd: ((n-3)/2)*12+((n-3)/2)((n-3)/2+1)*9.75+4.12+6.18

Even: ((n-2)/2)*12+(((n-2)/2)^2)*(16+(2*3.5/pi)arctan(.87566n - 4))/2 + 4.12

Some other info that no one will bother reading: 

I came up with the 4.12/6.18 split by analysing how Tom Nelson split up his corners and edges for the 3x3 part of the solve (corners and midges) and I used the same ratio (2:3). 

To derive the exact arctan expression, I used two very important pieces of information from Siggins, mainly that for 4x4 centers, it's 16 targets on average, for 6x6 it's 18 targets on average, and it approaches 19.5 targets as N approaches infinity, keeping in mind that algs is just targets/2 because 3-style. This was very convenient because the arctan function had the exact property I wanted; going from 16 to 18 in just an increment of 2 was pretty large, and we had a finite limit as n approaches infinity. So since 4x4 was essentially our starting point, as any even number input below that would be meaningless, I wanted the inflection point of the inverse tan graph to be n = 4. This means that the x variable in arctan(x) would be replaced with n - 4. Additionally, since the desireable values were from 16 to 19.5, this meant that the range was 3.5 The positive half of the arctan function has a range of pi/2, so I would have to multiply the arctan function by (2/pi)*(3.5) for the correct vertical dilation. However, we still need to add 16 because the inflection point of the standard arctan graph is at x = 0, and we want the target count to be 16 at the beginning when n = 4. Ok, that takes care of most of it, but we still need to use the 2nd point of data, that when n = 6 the target count is 18. This would be easy to do with a simple equation: 18 = 16 + (2*3.5/pi)arctan(cn - 4), where c is an unknown constant we have to mulitply n by to get the desired function. We want the equation to hold true when n is equal to 6, so we can solve for cn to find c. We get that cn is approximately 5.25396. Plugging in 6 for n, we get c = .87566. And finally, don't forget to divide by 2 in the final formula!
